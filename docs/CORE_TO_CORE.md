# Core-to-Core conversations

A Core holds only its own machine node and the user nodes placed on that machine. Anything that involves
another machine is a conversation: the Core you ask runs the steps and reaches the others at the addresses
stored beside each parent pointer.

## Settings (Core `.env`)

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SEMA_CORE_ADDRESS` | The stable name other Cores use to reach this one, e.g. `http://neo-main:4310`. Stored beside every pointer to a node held here. Leave unset on a single-machine setup. |
| `SEMA_CORE_PEER_APPLICATION_KEY`, `SEMA_CORE_PEER_SECRET` | The shared application credential presented to other Cores. It must be registered in each Core's `SEMA_APPLICATION_CLIENTS_JSON`. Later replaced by per-machine keys. |

Without the peer credential a Core still works alone; the conversation routes answer that they are not configured.

## Routes (all need `core.topology.write`, except the two reads)

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/core/topology/local` | The nodes this Core holds and its own address. |
| `GET /v1/core/topology/walk-up?nodeId=&nodeAddress=` | Parents in turn; stops where a machine cannot be reached. |
| `POST /v1/core/topology/create` `{parentId, parentAddress?, newNodeAddress?}` | New node under a parent, here or on the Core at `newNodeAddress`. Installing a machine and adding a user are this. |
| `POST /v1/core/topology/insert-above` `{childId, childAddress?, newNodeAddress?}` | New node between a node and its parent. |
| `POST /v1/core/topology/rehome` `{nodeId, nodeAddress?, newParentId, newParentAddress?, administratorOverride?}` | Move a node and its subtree. Only "under itself" is refused. |
| `POST /v1/core/topology/remove` `{nodeId, nodeAddress?, childrenParentId?}` | Retire; children follow the pointer later. |
| `POST /v1/core/topology/roll-up` `{nodeId, nodeAddress?, issuerId?}` | Shorter basis from the highest reachable ancestor. |
| `POST /v1/core/topology/repair-parent` `{nodeId, nodeAddress?}` | Point a node whose parent was retired at its nearest live ancestor. |

An address left out means "this Core". Each operation is audited by the Core that ran it.
